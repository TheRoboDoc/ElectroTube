# ElectroTube

**Electron wrapper for YouTube Music**

A standalone, cross-platform desktop application for enjoying [YouTube Music](https://music.youtube.com) without relying on browser extensions or Progressive Web App support.

## Why ElectroTube?

Firefox does not support installing YouTube Music as a standalone PWA (Progressive Web App), unlike Chromium-based browsers.

**ElectroTube** was created to solve that. It offers:

- A dedicated desktop app feel
- Independence from browser state or extensions
- Persistent window sizing and position
- Simple setup, no fluff

## Features

- Loads [https://music.youtube.com](https://music.youtube.com) in an Electron window
- Saves window dimensions and position between sessions
- Installer support for both **Windows** and **Linux (.deb / AppImage)**
